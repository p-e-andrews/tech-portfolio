I am currently a Senior at Wake Technical Community College.

This semester Fall 2023 I am taking Cloud Application Development (aka AWS cert) and Information Systems Business Concepts (a project management course).
In Spring 2024 I will have my last class as either a group capstone project or Work Based Learning (WBL). I very much want to have the hands-on professional experience of WBL so I'm searching for internships or jobs in the software industry.

I believe in transparency, context, and concise communication. I feel these are some of the core values that lead to efficiency and understanding.
Beyond that, I believe in humor and flexibility. With humor and flexibility in addition to the previous values, I think a team can be truly harmonious and positive.

I also believe in gardening which is why there is a small indignant lizard in a giant basil plant on the main page. We also have two rescue cats and a yard full of fat squirrels.
