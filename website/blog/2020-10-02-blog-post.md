title: Portfolio Begins : Summer 2023
---

This portfolio was initially a homework assignment in Fall 2022.
Inspired and encouraged by my family to build a better portfolio I recovered this homework from my school notes.

While exploring the files in the forked repo behind this assignment I have discovered that for personalization purposes, it may be better to create a new GitHub Page from scratch and use Jekyll to make it more my own.

In the meantime, this original version of the portfolio will act as my host and guinea pig for linking to and describing projects in various stages, my documentation and discoveries, and other things that may make my portfolio more whole.

Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy!
